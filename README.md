# Optical-Spectrum-Analyzer
This is a Django website that gets json data from a optical spectrum analyzer and displays it in a graph.
This was a challange given by Ciena as a first step in the interview process for a Instrumentation Automation Developer position.
While this program worked well on my personal computer in a virtual enviroment, I was unable to publish it or get it working from a file downloaded from Github. This most likley is easy to achieve, but due to my inexperience with Django I was unable to do so in time. I also tried to publish through Heroku, but again could not get it to run.
I learned a lot through this project. I had never worked with Django, Python, HTML, CSS, or even json formats before. I will continue to work on these languages as I enjoyed working with them.
