# Optical-Spectrum-Analyzer
This is a Django website that gets json data from a optical spectrum analyzer and displays it in a graph.
This was a challange given by Ciena as a first step in the interview process for a Instrumentation Automation Developer position.
I learned a lot through this project. I had never worked with Django, Python, HTML, CSS, or even json formats before. I will continue to work on these languages as I enjoyed working with them.
